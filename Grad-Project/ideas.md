# Me (what I want to do)
- Verilog HDL (digital ic design requirement)
- Information security
- (cyber security)

# Resource:
- The internet
- Library (textbook)
- Professors (EE, Information Engineering, Math, ideally in TKU)
- Graduate students (TA)

# Direction:
- Side channel attack (resistant system)
- Malware
- Intrusion detection system (IDS)
	- effectively anomaly detection
- Secure hardware design
- Cryptography (Purely encryption things)

# Difficulty:
- Could be no one other than me that knows what I'm researching
- Too difficult to be done in a year and a half
	- with learning verilog during the first half year
	- my information security knowledge is superficial at best

# Ideas ChatGPT threw me:
- Secure IoT hardware design
- *Lightweight Cryptographic ASIC for IoT security
	- lightweight cryptographic core optimized for low power, low-area applications
	- algorithms like SIMON or SPEK could be explored
- *Secure processor design for embedded systems
	- develop a RSIC-V or custom processor with built-in security features
- *Hardware root of trust
	- what is a root of trust?
- *Resistance to Side channel attacks (with cryptographic ASIC)
	- what kind of side channel attack??
- Hardware-Based Random number generator
	- Math and physics? it's essentially finding what's proven random and implement it


# What I know:
- basic attack vectors and its effect
- what exploits and vulnerable code could look like
	- from the cooler and better hackers

# Ehh??
- The more ideal part is that I make a cryptographic ASIC and simulate attack against it. Try to migate the risk and therefore making more secure.
- What even is IoT in this context?
	- **anything that exchange data**
