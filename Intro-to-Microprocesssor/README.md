# Introduction to Microprocessors
This class is a continuation to the ARM-ASM class, going deeper into the what and how a microprocessor works.

Astelor: I'll rewrite the notes for the previous chapters given the opportunity (probably never)
       : And please refer to the ARM-ASM folder for more elementary codes.

The scribbles will be written in the order of the professor's lecturing pace, since it make most sense for me to follow to some degree instead of going off chart.
