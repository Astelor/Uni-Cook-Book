# In the following
- Hardware: our targer machine **SIC/XE**
- Language: its ASM
- translator: assembler
- linker
- loader
- Macro Processor

# Computing history

Calculator vs Computer
- computers have memory to store
	- the variables, values
	- the data
	- the procedure
	- the programs
- calculators typically require human input

# The SIC/XE Machine
- SIC: Simplified Instructional Computer
	- instructional -> programmable
	- "instruction" is always programmable
		- must have memory
		- > embedded system is not included?
- Hypothetic machine
	- simple, concise
	- almost includes everything used in modern computer
	- doesn't have a complete real-world "physical" design
