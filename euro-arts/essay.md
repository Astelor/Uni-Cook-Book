# Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology

I read *Babel: Or the Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators' Revolution* and was quite fascinated by Oxford itself. Since I have no other choice of building, I picked this one where the main characters visited in the story.

> okay there's a [Old Ashmolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Science_Museum,_Oxford) and [New Ashmolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashmolean_Museum) one like wtf
>
> the characters in Babel probably visited the new one, but ehh it's outta scope

> so I guess i can include both? they are both Ashmolean museums.


> how tf do i structure it?

outline, not necessarily in the order:
1. history
   - can outline the culture then in 17th century and 19th century
     - such as why they built a new one and why someone built a museum to house their items in a university
   - how the building was built and why it was built
2. building
   - style of the building
   - choice of material
   - exterior
   - interior
3. items (since it's a museum)
   - anything interesting and major
     - like it's special and piece of its time
   - 
4. arts
   - > i guess this is included in the items since paintings and sculptures are
5. thoughts
   - > 心得(?)
   - > I know the existence of this museum because of the book. So I guess this book is successful in various ways?
