> so I guess i can include both? they are both Ashmolean museums.


> how tf do i structure it?

# outline, not necessarily in the order:
1. history
   - can outline the culture then in 17th century and 19th century
     - such as why they built a new one and why someone built a museum to house their items in a university
   - how the building was built and why it was built
2. building
   - style of the building
   - choice of material
   - exterior
   - interior
3. items (since it's a museum)
   - anything interesting and major
     - like it's special and piece of its time
   - arts, sculpture, items of significance
4. thoughts
   - > 心得(?)
   - > I know the existence of this museum because of the book. So I guess this book is successful in various ways?
   - > Babel heheh oxford
5. references

# misc draft i write

> note that this is explicitly YOUR own output, not copy-pasting

I read *Babel: Or the Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators' Revolution* and was quite fascinated by Oxford itself. Since I have no other choice of building in mind, I picked this one that the main characters visited in the story.

The novel discussed the inequality in races using the main characters' interactions with the early 19th Oxford, England. The museum itself is a "stealing" from other cultures, just like how the young translators in the book was plucked from remote countries, only to use their mother language for the empire's prosperity. I'd imagine the author used this parallelism to show how out of place they are, just like the exhibits in the museum.

# history

> the modification of copying and pasting begins

The Ashmolean is the University of Oxford’s museum of art and archaeology and is one of four University museums (along with the Museum of the History of Science, the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and the Pitt Rivers Museum). The four museums form part of the University's GLAM (Gardens, Libraries and Museums) group, together with the Bodleian Libraries and Botanic Gardens and Harcourt Arboretum. [[1]](#cite1)

It's Britain's first public museum [[2]](#cite2)

# mumbling

> isn't it essentially copy and pasting? so it's not like writing the 1984 report, 90% of the 1984 report are my words since I actually read the book and materials, and it requires a topic to be talked about. but this is just text finding. i guess it makes sense since it's introducing something, not discussing something.
>
> and the professor didn't explicitly stated what language I should write it in. i'm going to write it in english, since i failed to find an interesting chinese book to read this semester, all of the read i did was english :')
>
> I only managed to write the 1984 report in chinese because i read Red Roulette, my chinese wording training was at best spotty :')
>
> I guess this is a great opportunity to practice proper citing.
>
> surely if I do it little by little for 2 weeks i can achieve a lot of words like i did with the 1984 report. it was 3500 words, surely it's not that hard.
