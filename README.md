# Uni-Cook-Book
The cook book (notes) of my university (years) studies, outta spite. (This is also a testament to my eloquence and file organizing abilities.)

This repository includes but not limits to:
1. University subjects.
2. My own learning and research.
3. Anything worth cooking.

> The indexes here are ill-kept, go straight to the code section and the contents are kept within the folders named accordingly.
