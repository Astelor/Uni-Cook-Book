# Uni-Cook-Book

The cook book (notes) of my university (years) studies, outta ~~spite~~ love. (This is also a testament to my eloquence and file organizing abilities.)

This repository includes but not limits to:

1. University subjects.
2. My own learning and research.
3. Anything worth cooking.

This repository is best suited for:

1. Astelor
2. Probably not you

**All the resource copies and attachments saved in this repository are for educational purposes, and do not belong to me.**

# Why cook-book?

It's more topic focused instead of random notes I jotted down, so there's a notebook and a public notebook. 

# Navigation?

I've made up my mind to make this repository a labyrinth. :]

# Note to self 

- The image link shouldn't have any url-encoded symbol (e.g. a space)
- The link to navigate by file and to section doesn't work on mobile.
- The latex formula rendering doesn't work on mobile.

If you can see the equation above properly, you're not using MathJax.
And this sentence is on a single new line.
