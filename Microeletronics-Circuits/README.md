# Microelectronics Circuits
yes

please view the files in web browsers, as LaTeX (the math equations syntax) doesn't render properly in mobile.

# Note to self
## LaTex markdown
- if the syntax translates into a link, put space between them.
- Texts above the equation is where or how it comes from, below is the definitions to it.
- [chapter 5](05-MOSFET.md) is a good example to good math equation markdown (to me rn)

chapter 1~4 is very unreadable, please find time to rewrite them if you can :)

> Astelor: I'm infinitely annoyed that the professor doesn't elaborate much about "how" it works, just "it works like that and the equations look like this, memorize it and that's it" There's a reason I chose engineering over social science, I cannot and hate memorizing shit. There's a phenomenon first then there's a math description.
