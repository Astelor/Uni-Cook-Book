- [Chapter 5, MOSFET](05-MOSFET.md)
- [Chapter 6, Bipolar Junction Transistor](06-BJT.md)
- [Chapter 7, Transistor Amplifier](07-Transistor-Amp.md)

# Note to self
## LaTex markdown
- if the syntax translates into a link, put space between them.
- Texts above the equation is where or how it comes from, below is the definitions to it.
- [chapter 5](05-MOSFET.md) is a good example to good math equation markdown (to me rn)
- Apparently github supports MathJax, and it doesn't like phasors $\phase{e}$
- chapter 3 is very unreadable, please find time to rewrite them if you can :)

## TO-DO
- make a "tl;dr" for every section
  - give it a special symbol for quick access
  - `◈` this thing?
- > ◈ TL;DR
  - template :)

> Astelor: I'm infinitely annoyed that the professor doesn't elaborate much about "how" it works, just "it works like that and the equations look like this, memorize it and that's it" There's a reason I chose engineering over pretty much anything else, I cannot and hate memorizing shit. There's a phenomenon first then there's a math description.
