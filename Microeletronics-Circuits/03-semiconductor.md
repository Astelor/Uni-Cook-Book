# Chapter 3, Semiconductor
- Basis for understanding the physical operation of diodes and transistors.
- *pn* junction → bipolar junction transistor (BJT, Chapter 6) → field-effect transistors (FETs, Chapter 5)

## 3.1 Intrinsic Semiconductors
- As the name suggests, it doesn't have any impurity.
### Two types of Intrinsic Semiconductors
- **Single-element semiconductors**
  - group IV in the periodic table (germanium and silicon)
  - Germanium: used in the fabrication of early(~1950s) transistors.
  - Silicon: universally used today.
- **Compound semiconductors**
  - formed by combining elements from groups III and V or groups II and VI (gallium-arsenide).
  - useful in applications that involve light → light-emitting diodes.

### Within the Crystal
A silicon atom has 4 valence electrons, it requires another 4 to complete its outer most shell. Each pair of shared electrons forms a covalent bond.

> 1 kelvin = -272.15 celsius
> 1 celsius = 272.15 kelvin
### Characteristics
- at 0K (absolute zero)
  - **insulator**
  - all the covalent bonds are intact, no electrons are available to conduct electric current. (no free electrons zooming, no current generated)
- at 300K (room temperature)
  - **conductor**
  - **thermal generation**:
    - thermal energy breaking covalent bonds → electron freed → free electron go zoooooom.
  - **free electron**:
    - a negative charged carrier
    - Available to conduct electric current IF an electric field is applied to the crystal.
  - **hole**:
    - a positive charged carrier
    - The electron leaves its parent atom → left behind a net positive charge
  - Increase in the numbers of free electrons and holes results in a increase in the conductivity.
  
### Thermal Generation
Generates EQUAL numbers of free electrons and holes.

$n_i=BT^{3/2}e^{-E_g/2kT}$
