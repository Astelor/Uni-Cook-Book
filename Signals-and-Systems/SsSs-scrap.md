- if the system isn't LTI
 - Causal and BIBO stable needs to be done by their definitions
 
# QUIZ 1

> Some take aways from this test.

## Causal (by definition)

Output only depends on previous input.

```
y(a)=x(b), a>b
```

## BIBO stable (by definition)

If the input is bounded, the output should be bounded.
