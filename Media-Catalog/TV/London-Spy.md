A well written story with excellent choice of casts. 
The story revolves around the mystery of the death of a MI6 spy, Alistair Turner. After his disappearance, his partner Danny Holt tried to decipher where he had gone and who he really is, but by the time he realized it's all a multi-governmental conspiracy, there's no turning back for him.

## Take Away
This is a story about refusing to letting go, even if it hurts like hell, even if the path before lies with deaths. He still fearlessly move forward, to the justice he deserves.

> Danny: "I have a question. How do we live without the people that we love? I can hear his reply. "We must figure this question out for ourselves." He's right. He was always right. Except, my friend... I don't want to know. I don't want to know how to live without you. I don't want to figure out how to stop feeling this sad."

## Murmur
(spoilers)
Anyway, this one cuts deep because I just finished 1984 and wrote an essay about it, about how a totalitarianism government can destroy the most resilient individual by deprivation of the essence of humanity, such as love, connection, friendship, and any material ordinary to the free world.

To me, Alex was terminated by the doubt of the government, he was killed by the mole hunt as Scottie said, but Alex wasn't as lucky as the retired spy, they used the extraordinaire's work against him, a bit personal I would say, to detect if he's telling the truth.

However, if Alex has been lying for his entire life, would the model still be accurate on him? There's no truth on him to begin with, there's no standard of "truthful pattern" for the model to be trained with. I think Alex was murdered because of his shuffle of priority, he loved Danny, and the government feared that he's no longer loyal, so they kidnapped Alex in his own flat, framed him to be untruthful and disloyal with a model that probably can't read Alex's truthfulness.

And after they are in a relationship, which perhaps motivated Alex to finish the project, and lead to his own demise. I would also say that, yes, Danny indirectly led Alex to his own grave.

The story isn't that closely knitted, there are some obscure scenes that perplexes me.

Serious things aside, I think Ben Whishaw is a brilliant actor. :widePeepoHappy:
