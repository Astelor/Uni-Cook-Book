# chapter 7, first-order circuits

> RC and RL circuits

- **first-order circuits**
  - first-order differential equation from analysis
  - RC and RL
- **excite the circuits**
  1. *source-free circuits*
     - initial conditions of the storage elements
     - by definition free of independent sources
  2. *independent sources*

# 7.2 the source-free RC circuit

- what is it?
  - occurs when dc source is suddenly disconnected
  - energy already stored in the capacitor is released to the resistors
