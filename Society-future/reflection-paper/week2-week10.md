# week2

> Hello everyone, 
> 
> attached you will find the template that you can use to answer the questions/do the reflection paper. You can use it, but you can also simply use a word document or this platform or whatever. Just make sure that you understand the assignment.

> Apologies for the late upload. The system went back up last night but I was unfortunately occupied. I do think friday 6pm deadline will give you plenty time to do this. Check the PPt slides if you need some reminder of what we did.

1) I think the statistics definitely reflect the majority of anxiety in our generation, because the world does seem like it’s going down in a spiral, with monopolies holding our wages hostage, and with trying to pursue better education or lifestyle hijacked by the capitalism or social ranks (We were taught otherwise, but it’s very unfortunately true). I think it’s part of the reason why the young living in advanced economics are less happy while in the developing countries are the opposite. It’s a bit like Taiwan 30 years ago, in industrial development, the opportunities are for everyone, you don’t necessarily need a college degree to make a fortune. However, nowadays you get (a little bit more than) minimum wage even with an engineering degree, I doubt anyone would be happy with that.

2) Sleeping, we literally need that to survive and function normally. To put it in perspective, I could stay up until 3 am gaming, watching Breaking Bad, or doing anything I didn't do because of my poor time management, and feel astronomically sleepy the next day. I couldn't focus on anything in class and feel frustrated on public transportation because I couldn't be awake enough to mind the gaps (fortunately I didn't fall). I did that, yes. Did it feel good staying up? yes. What did I get out of it? I got obliterated health, friendships ("Sorry I cannot be there for you because I stayed up for no reason and in need of sleep") and  academic performance. So yes, sleeping and waking (or more generally time management) responsibly is definitely critical in terms of long-term thinking in life choices.

> Very interesting that you chose sleeping. an often overlooked cheat code to better functioning. Agreed. it reminds of the slide i showed about being addicted to the now and rewards NOW.
