# week 11


> For you to practice the CLA Method, this week I'm asking everyone to look up a news article from the last 7 days. This article needs to be from your country. I want you to deconstruct the article(topic) with Causal Layered Analysis.

> Remember the examples I gave today - sometimes you can find some of the layers in the article (mostly second layer) and sometimes you don't. If the article doesn't provide you with any information for the layers, you have to think critically about the article(topic).

**litany:**
- C and C++ are not a "memory safe" programming language and if not written with care, can cause a lot of problem.
- The companies and open source projects are suggested by the CISA to switch from memory-unsafe languages to memory-safe languages.
- But the change not going to happen fast.

**systematic causes:**
- Memory safety vulnerabilities account for 70 percent of security vulnerabilities.
- C/C++ have been the prevailing programming language for a long time.
- C/C++ requires the developer to handle the memory manually. (you could do whatever you want with the system resources programming in C/C++, it's essentially chaos language, older and most widely used)
- The memory-safe languages such as Rust, Java, Go, have built-in memory-safety (preventing the programs or programmers from creating common bugs).
- It could take a lot of money, resources, time, and meticulous planning to re-write years of C/C++ codebase (proprietary or free) to memory-safe languages.
- Switching programming language means investing in and switching to new developing tools, environment, and debugger.
- Poorly written code, doesn't matter the programming language, leads to vulnerabilities in programs, fixing them or someone exploiting them are loss of money and time.

**worldview:**
- Make the cyber world as a whole safer.
- Less errors to correct equals less resource strain.
- The memory-safe language might not be as fast and efficient as C/C++.
- Senior C/C++ programmers don't really have a reason to switch language, especially the operating system kernel maintainers, since they know how to write good code.
- Steep learning curve, the memory-safe languages are very different from C/C++.

- Confronted with cost-effectivity and security, security is typically an after-thought.
  - Programmers make programs with the required functions first, then wrap it with layers of protection. It's hardly a good practice, your protection could fail when someone finds a way to by-pass it.

**metaphors & myths:**
- Rome wasn't built in a day.

**murmuring section**

Honestly, most of the articles in Taiwan concerning global issues are translated, or even worse, machine translated articles from foreign newspapers. I know there's a "war" happening in Taiwan about revising the law to literally make constitution judges powerless, but the US government declaring C and C++ "illegal" is funnier to me, not that the constitution doesn't matter.

To be fair, it feels like cheating since a friend of mine sent me this article this week, asking what I think about it. 

Wow, why are most of the news about who died or who murdered who. Can't they created a section specifically for it, because I feel number and number scrolling through the violence news searching for something else worth my time.
