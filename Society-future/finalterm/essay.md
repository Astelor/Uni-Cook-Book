1. Decide on a social problem/issue (e.g. wicked problem) or a social topic that you want to explore.

4. What are the used futures regarding the problem? Meaning: Solutions or ideas about solving the issue or topic that are continuously used but don’t serve us anymore (See Futures Triangle Slides for better understanding)

B - **Causal Layered Analysis – Reconstruction** (25%)
1. What is the preferred future of this topic (in 2050)? What does it look like on the Litany level? And then on all four levels?
2. Why is this the preferred future? Who stands to benefit from it? Who may be disadvantaged?

C – **Backcasting** (25%)
1. To arrive at that preferred future, think of the decisions that need to be made along the way. Think of the actions that need to be taken (by governments, legislators, companies, thought leaders, the public) Structure them along a timeline until the preferred future in 2050.
2. Judge the plausibility of the preferred future. Is it plausible? Why do you or don’t you think so?

# murmur
