# Basic Concepts
This is right after the history parts end. To make it easier to find information, I separated this into another file.

## 1.4 Number systems
The only thing new is "base"

[淺談Base64與應用實例分享](https://blog.errorbaker.tw/posts/cian/base64-qrcode/)

- Decimal (base 10)
  - 44687
- Binary (base 2)
  - 1010 1110 1000 1111
- Hexadecimal (base 16)
  - 0xAE8F
  - 0 ~ 9, A ~ F.

## 1.5 Representations of Numbers and CHaracters
It's the programmer who's responsible for interpreting the results that a processor provides, AND　making it clear in the code.
- The machine: 0x6E
  - A value, 0x6E
- Programmer:
  - character?
  - number?
  - fractional value?

## 1.5.1 Integer Representations
### Two's Complement

## 1.5.2 Floating-Point Representations

## 1.5.3 Character Representations
- American Standard Code for Information Exchange (ASCII)

## 1.6 Translating Bits to Commands
- Machine bit-patterns: (what processor see)
```
E0CC31B0
1AFFFFF1
E3A0D008
```
- Programming: (what programmer reads)
  - Substituting hex-bit-pattern to mnemonics
    - easier for human to memorize, read, and debug.
```
STRH  sum, [pointer], #16
BNE   loop_one
MOV   count, #8 
```
- The translating process is done by assembler.

## 1.7 The Tools
- Compiler:
  - High-level language -> instructions
- Assembler:
  - Instructions -> machine language
  - Different tools have different preferred syntax(?)
