# Miscellaneous

Mostly scribbles and things can be shuffling around constantly.

- : Why in the Uni-cook-book?
  - Because I'm lazy and will likely forget where I put things. So I'm placing all the eggs in one basket and hope for the best.
- : Why misc?
  - This monstrosity of a repository is a labyrinth, I know where everything is and navigating will only become more difficult for the others as I keep shoving everything here.
- : Clean up the other folder?
  - no.
  - well maybe one day, but unlikely today.
