> I AM NO PLEB!!

**This is a learning note, seek professional help when building a computer**

# Funny term bracket
bruh
- TDP (Thermal Design Power)
- PCIe (PCI Express, Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)
- 

# UHHH
> aka wtf am I looking at

## TDP
> Thermal Design Power, the amount of heat a component is expected to output when under load.

## Chipset
> On motherboards, manages the flow of data between CPU, RAM, and peripherals.

- Dictates **features** you can or cannot use with your CPU.

## PCIe
> PCI Express, Peripheral Component Interconnect Express

- high-speed serial computer expansion bus
- common motherboard interface for 
  - graphics cards
  - sound cards
  - hard disk drive
  - SSDs
  - Wi-Fi and Ethernet hardware connection
- **backward compatible**

> What I usually use my desktop for.

Entertainment:
- twitch
- youtube
- Minecraft (sometimes)

Work:
- Coding
- Matlab
- Keil tool
- a lotta tabs

Other:
- Virtual box
- study and research

> CPU and RAM

# CPU
> What you see on the market: Product collection, Processor number.

Benchmark: https://www.cpubenchmark.net

Efficiency:
- number of cores

Compatibility:
- socket type
- power

uhhhh idk I just picked whatever's between NT5k and NT10k.

I chose Intel because compatibility (I think), and all the items on the list has LGA 1700 socket.

# Motherboard
> What you see on the market: Chipset, manufacturer

Because Chipset is what brings all (processor, memory, peripheral) together, it makes sense to put Chipset into the product's name.

- PCIe
- SATA
- M.2
- U.2
