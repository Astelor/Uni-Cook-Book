# chapter 2, introduction to quantum mechanics

# 2.1 principles of quantum mechanics

**three principles**:
1. the principle of energy quanta
2. the wave-particle duality principle
3. the uncertainty principle

## 2.1.1 energy quanta

> **photoelectric effect**: if *monochromatic light* (light with a fixed frequency) is incident (hit) on a clean surface of a material, when the incident light's frequency is above the *limiting frequency* *v_0*, electrons (photoelectrons) are emitted from the surface.
>
> in other words, if the incident light frequency is not above the limiting frequency *v_0*, no photoelectron is produced.

**definitions**:
- `quanta`:
  - > Planck: thermal radiation is emitted from a heated surface in *`discrete` packets of energy* called `quanta`
- `photon`:
  - > Einstein: interpreted the photoelectric effect by suggesting the energy in a light wave is also contained in discrete packets, and called the *discrete packet of energy* a `photon`
  - a `photon` with *sufficient energy* can knock an electron from the surface of the material
    - which is the *photoelectric effect*: `photon` hit the material, the material spits out an `photoelectron`
  - any *excess `photon` energy* goes into the *kinetic energy* of the `photoelectron`
- `work function` (of the material):
  - minimum energy required to remove an electron

> Planck and Einstein are describing the same thing, but from different experiments.

**equations**:
- energy of `quanta`/`photon`
  - $E=h\nu$
  - *ν*: frequency of the radiation
    - ν is pronounced "nu", is a greek alphabet
  - *h*: Planck's constant *h* = 6.625 × 10^-34 J-s
- **maximum kinetic energy** of the `photoelectron` 
  - $T=\frac{1}{2}m\nu^2=hv-\Phi=h\nu$
