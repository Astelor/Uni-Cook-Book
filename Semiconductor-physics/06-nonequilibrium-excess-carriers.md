# chapter 6, non-equilibrium excess carriers in semiconductors

- excess carriers
  - occurs when an *external excitation* is applied to the semiconductor
- **ambipolar transport**
  - the excess electrons and holes do not move independently of each other

# 6.1 carrier generation and recombination

- **generation**
  - the process whereby electrons and holes are *created*
- **recombination**
  - the process whereby electrons and holes are *annihilated*

- example of **non-equilibrium condition**, *changing the carrier concentrations*
  - any deviation from thermal equilibrium
    - a sudden increase in temperature
  - an external excitation, such as light (a flux of photons)
- **direct band-to-band** generation and recombination
  - 1 free electron created = 1 hole created

## 6.1.1 the semiconductor in equilibrium

> tl;dr. 
> no external force = semiconductor in thermal equilibrium, and everything's quiet and peaceful and **perfectly balanced**

- **thermal-generation rates**
  - $G_{n0}$, $G_{p0}$ for electrons and holes
  - units: $\#/cm^3-s$
  - for *direct band-to-band*: $G_{n0}=G_{p0}$
- **recombination rates** for a semiconductor in thermal equilibrium
  - $R_{n0}$, $R_{p0}$ for electrons and holes
  - units: $\#/cm^3-s$
  - for *direct band-to-band*: $R_{n0}=R_{p0}$
- **in thermal equilibrium**
  - the concentrations of electrons and holes are *independent of time*
  - $G_{n0}=G_{p0}=R_{n0}=R_{p0}$
  
## 6.1.2 excess carrier generation and recombination

> tl;dr. 
> yes external force = semiconductor having excess electrons and holes and in **non-equilibrium**

- the excess carriers are generated by an **external force** *at a particular rate*
    - perturbing the equilibrium condition
    - â†’ semiconductor no longer in thermal equilibrium
    - **steady-state generation** of excess carriers will *not* cause a *continual buildup of the carrier concentrations*
      - electrons recombine with holes in pairs
        - electrons fall down to valence band and combine with holes 
- **generation rate** of *excess* electrons and holes
  - $g_n'$, $g_p'$
  - units: $\#/cm^3-s$
  - for *direct band-to-band*: $g_n'=g_p'$
    - the excess electrons and holes are created in pairs
- **electron and hole concentration** when excess carriers are created
  - $n=n_0+\delta n$
  - $p=p_0+\delta p$
  - $n_0$, $p_0$: thermal equilibrium concentrations
  - in such non-equilibrium condition: $np\ne n_0 p_0=n_i^2$
- **recombination rate** of *excess* electrons and holes
  - $R_n'$, $R_p'$
  - units: $\#/cm^3-s$
  - for *direct band-to-band*: $R_n' = R_p'$

- **net rate of change in the electron concentration**
  - $\frac{dn(t)}{dt} = \alpha_r[n_i^2 - n(t)p(t)]$
    - $\alpha_r n_i^2$: thermal-equilibrium generation rate
    - $n(t) = n_0 + \delta n(t)$
    - $p(t) = p_0 + \delta p(t)$
    - **$\delta n(t) = \delta p(t)$**: excess electrons and holes are *created and recombined in pairs*
  - $\begin{align*} \frac{d(\delta n(t))}{dt} &= \alpha_r [n_i^2 -(n_0+\delta n(t))(p_0+\delta p(t))] \\&= -\alpha_r \delta n(t)[(n_0+p_0)+\delta n(t)] \end{align*}$
    - $n_0$ is independent of time
    - $n_0p_0=n_i^2$
    - can be solved under *low-level injection*

  - **p-type** material ($p_0\gg n_0$)
    - under *low-level injection* ($\delta n(t) \ll p_0$)
    - $\frac{d(\delta n(t))}{dt} = -\alpha_r \delta n(t) p_0$


- **low and high level injection**
  - **low-level injection**
    - puts *limits* on the magnitude of the *excess carrier concentration* compared with the *thermal-equilibrium carrier concentrations*
    - **n-type** extrinsic material
      - $n_0 \gg p_0$
      - $n_0 \gg \delta p(t)$
    - **p-type** extrinsic material
      - $p_0 \gg n_0$
      - $p_0 \gg \delta n(t)$
  - **high-level injection**
    - occurs when the *excess carrier concentration* becomes *comparable* to or greater than the *thermal-equilibrium majority carrier concentrations*
    - > not common to occur
